# Data Science research projects

This repository stores some DS projects created during my studentship at Yandex Practicum (2022-2023). Ostensibly, they prove that I can bring some value to a DS/ML team. 

Here's a brief recap:

## Used car price prediction
**Problem Situation**: A supposed car dealership is developing an app to attract new customers. In it you can quickly find out the market value of your car.

**Task**: to build a model to determine the cost, the RMSE metric should be less than 2500 euros.

## Gold recovery prediction
**Problem situation:** on the request for our customer we need to optimize production in order to successfully launch an industrial enterprise while avoiding losses.

**Task:** to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from an ore.

## Predicting an optimal oil well location
**Problem situation:** On assignment for a fictitious mining company we help to decide where to drill a new oil well.

**Task:** to determine the most profitable region for the development of oil wells using Classic ML approach.

## Predicting a number of taxi orders (time series ML)
**Problem situation:** Our fictional customer wants to attract more drivers during peak periods.

**Task:** build a model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.

## Classification of texts for an online store

**Problem situation:** a fictional online shop is launching a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. I.e. clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others.

**Task:** building a model for classifying positive and negative comments.
